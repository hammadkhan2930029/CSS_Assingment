            <h1>15 Great Cat Poems Not Written By Cats
                Happy Poetry Month or Something</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            <p>If humans were immortal, like I suspect cats are, today would be the birthday of Christopher Smart, an
                English poet who was both infamous and influential in his day (1722-1771) but is now mostly known for
                his long religious poem Jubilate Agno, and in particular for one section from Jubilate Agno, an
                in-depth, ecstatic, truly ludicrous and wonderful consideration of his cat, whose name is Jeoffry. On
                the occasion of Smartâ€™s birthday, and also because I love you, I have decided to highlight this poem and
                some other good poems either about or memorably featuring cats. Please enjoy, and feel free to add more
                kitty poems to the list in the comments.</p>
