            <p> <span id="one"> The Ocean Taught Me About A Broken Heart</span><br />
                I carried my broken heart to the ocean shore
                to cast into the water and let drift forevermore

                the gentle winds spoke about the beauty there
                as seabird's noisy calls resounded thru the air

                waves lapped the beach in its timeless destiny
                the sky was full of colors painted just for me

                watching the golden sun slip into the twilight
                still I remained pondering through the night

                silvery moonlight danced over windswept seas
                and reminded me the tides changed constantly

                my problems vanished in the vastness of it all
                compared to the ocean my broken heart
                was small....</p>

                Twas on a lofty vase's side,
                Where China's gayest art had dyed
                The azure flowers that blow;
                Demurest of the tabby kind,
                The pensive Selima, reclined,
                Gazed on the lake below.

                Her conscious tail her joy declared;
                The fair round face, the snowy beard,
                The velvet of her paws,
                Her coat, that with the tortoise vies,
                Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,
                She saw; and purred applause.

                Still had she gazed; but 'midst the tide
                Two angel forms were seen to glide,
                The genii of the stream:
                Their scaly armor's Tyrian hue
                Through richest purple to the view
                Betrayed a golden gleam.

                The hapless nymph with wonder saw:</p>

                I.
                I line my mind with fluorescent cumulous clouds,
                white mountains drifting in seas of baby blue sky
                stealing blue bird darts
                across my vision spectrum
                and nestles in a nearby bush
                a soft wind blows,
                blue rain drops....

                II.
                When the wind blows shut
                the iron door
                and I
                slow sink back into watery grains
                of occupational quick sand
                it's storming outside now

                III.
                Delusional escapade:
                skipping along an emerald forest trail
                dotted with fruit-flavored
                gum drop trees
                Cheshire cat ornaments decorating
                finger-like branch tips
                and yellow and white daisies
                bobbing on undulating waves</p>

            <p><span id="one">A frightening lullaby</span><br />
                Little buds raised their
                heads from their mothers womb
                but spring like a reluctant
                bride stayed back at the gate.

                Let not the buds to bloom
                Snow white jasmines and lilies
                showering their blessings from sky
                The buds all in frenzy mood.

                Showing their gratitude
                swinging and smiling in full moon
                silver night, whistled the wind
                a scarry mournful tune.

                Began to recite a
                frightening lullaby out side
                the door, I pulled my quilt
                over head said my prayers and.

                Began snoring like a wild boar
                when milk man rang the bell I
                opened the doors ; saw dry, leaves
                between mosquito net and window sill.

                Drumming attuned to roaring.
                wind like a birdy caught
                between beast's jaws pleading
                in a moaning tune through out..
                By,
                Padma BHaskaran</p>
